## SparkContext启动向master发送消息
- ClientEndpoint向master发送消息: RegisterApplication

```scala
    /**
     *  Register with all masters asynchronously and returns an array `Future`s for cancellation.
     */
    private def tryRegisterAllMasters(): Array[JFuture[_]] = {
      for (masterAddress <- masterRpcAddresses) yield {
        registerMasterThreadPool.submit(new Runnable {
          override def run(): Unit = try {
            if (registered.get) {
              return
            }
            logInfo("Connecting to master " + masterAddress.toSparkURL + "...")
            val masterRef =
              rpcEnv.setupEndpointRef(Master.SYSTEM_NAME, masterAddress, Master.ENDPOINT_NAME)
            masterRef.send(RegisterApplication(appDescription, self))
          } catch {
            case ie: InterruptedException => // Cancelled
            case NonFatal(e) => logWarning(s"Failed to connect to master $masterAddress", e)
          }
        })
      }
    }
```


## master处理消息RegisterApplication
- 创建 Application 并注册到master上
- Application 保存到 master 存储引擎中
- 向driver发送已注册成功消息: RegisteredApplication

```scala
    case RegisterApplication(description, driver) => {
      // TODO Prevent repeated registrations from some driver
      if (state == RecoveryState.STANDBY) {
        // ignore, don't send response
      } else {
        logInfo("Registering app " + description.name)
        val app = createApplication(description, driver)
        registerApplication(app)
        logInfo("Registered app " + description.name + " with ID " + app.id)
        persistenceEngine.addApplication(app)
        driver.send(RegisteredApplication(app.id, self))
        schedule()
      }
    }

```

- 过滤所有已注册的Worker(状态为ALIVE)
- 遍历 waitingDrivers，如果有等待中的Drivers,给worker发送启动Driver消息: LaunchDriver
- 调用在worker上启动executor方法

```scala
 /**
   * Schedule the currently available resources among waiting apps. This method will be called
   * every time a new app joins or resource availability changes.
   */
  private def schedule(): Unit = {
    if (state != RecoveryState.ALIVE) {
      return
    }
    // Drivers take strict precedence over executors
    val shuffledAliveWorkers = Random.shuffle(workers.toSeq.filter(_.state == WorkerState.ALIVE))
    val numWorkersAlive = shuffledAliveWorkers.size
    var curPos = 0
    for (driver <- waitingDrivers.toList) { // iterate over a copy of waitingDrivers
      // We assign workers to each waiting driver in a round-robin fashion. For each driver, we
      // start from the last worker that was assigned a driver, and continue onwards until we have
      // explored all alive workers.
      var launched = false
      var numWorkersVisited = 0
      while (numWorkersVisited < numWorkersAlive && !launched) {
        val worker = shuffledAliveWorkers(curPos)
        numWorkersVisited += 1
        if (worker.memoryFree >= driver.desc.mem && worker.coresFree >= driver.desc.cores) {
          launchDriver(worker, driver)
          waitingDrivers -= driver
          launched = true
        }
        curPos = (curPos + 1) % numWorkersAlive
      }
    }
    startExecutorsOnWorkers()
  }
```


- 过滤waitingApps,刚才注册的Application已经在ArrayBuffer中
- 对已注册的worker进行过滤
- 过滤条件状态为ALIVE,可用cpu内核数大于等于每个executor的内核数，可用内存大于等于Application在每个executor需要的内存数
- 对可用worker进行排序(按可用内核数从大到小排序)
- 调用方法 scheduleExecutorsOnWorkers，worker给executor分配多少个cpu内核

```scala

  /**
   * Schedule and launch executors on workers
   */
  private def startExecutorsOnWorkers(): Unit = {
    // Right now this is a very simple FIFO scheduler. We keep trying to fit in the first app
    // in the queue, then the second app, etc.
    for (app <- waitingApps if app.coresLeft > 0) {
      val coresPerExecutor: Option[Int] = app.desc.coresPerExecutor
      // Filter out workers that don't have enough resources to launch an executor
      val usableWorkers = workers.toArray.filter(_.state == WorkerState.ALIVE)
        .filter(worker => worker.memoryFree >= app.desc.memoryPerExecutorMB &&
          worker.coresFree >= coresPerExecutor.getOrElse(1))
        .sortBy(_.coresFree).reverse
      val assignedCores = scheduleExecutorsOnWorkers(app, usableWorkers, spreadOutApps)

      // Now that we've decided how many cores to allocate on each worker, let's allocate them
      for (pos <- 0 until usableWorkers.length if assignedCores(pos) > 0) {
        allocateWorkerResourceToExecutors(
          app, assignedCores(pos), coresPerExecutor, usableWorkers(pos))
      }
    }
  }
```


- 进行具体的当前Application在Worker上给executor分配几个cpu内核

```scala
 /**
   * Schedule executors to be launched on the workers.
   * Returns an array containing number of cores assigned to each worker.
   *
   * There are two modes of launching executors. The first attempts to spread out an application's
   * executors on as many workers as possible, while the second does the opposite (i.e. launch them
   * on as few workers as possible). The former is usually better for data locality purposes and is
   * the default.
   *
   * The number of cores assigned to each executor is configurable. When this is explicitly set,
   * multiple executors from the same application may be launched on the same worker if the worker
   * has enough cores and memory. Otherwise, each executor grabs all the cores available on the
   * worker by default, in which case only one executor may be launched on each worker.
   *
   * It is important to allocate coresPerExecutor on each worker at a time (instead of 1 core
   * at a time). Consider the following example: cluster has 4 workers with 16 cores each.
   * User requests 3 executors (spark.cores.max = 48, spark.executor.cores = 16). If 1 core is
   * allocated at a time, 12 cores from each worker would be assigned to each executor.
   * Since 12 < 16, no executors would launch [SPARK-8881].

- 分配worker资源给executor
- 给worker发送启动executor消息： LaunchExecutor
- 给driver发送Executor已增加消息：ExecutorAdded
